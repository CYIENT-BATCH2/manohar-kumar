Weights among three people
Taken the three inputs like x,y,z
Each carries value as low or high.
Compared to 'y'  'z' and 'x' value is greater means 'x' is high.
Like that for same as 'y' and 'z' also.
if 'x' is less than 'y' and 'y' is equality of 'z' then it will print 'y' and 'z' is bigger.
Same thing is happened in each condition and print the largest weight among three.
